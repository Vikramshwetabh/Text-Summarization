# Text Summarization Project with Pronoun Replacement

üöÄ Excited to Share My Latest Project on Text Summarization! üìÑ‚ú®

I‚Äôm thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project, which tackles a significant challenge in text summarization by integrating pronoun replacement techniques into existing algorithms. Here's a quick overview of how it works and the technologies used:

## üîç Project Overview

The project focuses on enhancing the quality of text summaries by properly handling pronouns, which are crucial for maintaining coherence and context in the summarized text. The primary steps involved are:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: The input text is cleaned and tokenized, removing special characters and stop words.
2. **POS Tagging**: Each word is tagged with its part of speech using the NLTK library.
3. **Pronoun Replacement**: Pronouns in the text are replaced with the nearest preceding noun, ensuring the summary retains crucial information and context.
4. **Sentence Weight Calculation**: Each sentence is assigned a weight based on the frequency of significant words.
5. **Summary Generation**: The highest-weighted sentences are selected to form a concise summary.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language for implementing the algorithms.
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and POS tagging.
- **Regular Expressions**: For text preprocessing and pattern matching.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical operations and sorting.

## üí° How It Works

1. **Input Text**: The user provides a block of text to be summarized.
2. **Preprocessing**: The text is converted to lowercase, and special characters and stop words are removed.
3. **POS Tagging**: Each word is tagged to identify nouns and pronouns.
4. **Pronoun Replacement**: Pronouns are replaced with their nearest preceding nouns to maintain clarity.
5. **Weight Calculation**: Sentences are weighted based on word frequencies.
6. **Summary Extraction**: The top-weighted sentences are extracted to create a coherent and comprehensive summary.

This project addresses key research gaps in text summarization by ensuring that summaries are both accurate and informative, especially in retaining the finer details present in the original text.

Looking forward to exploring more in this exciting field and contributing further to the advancements in natural language processing!

1. **Clone the repository:**
https://github.com/Vikramshwetabh/Text-Summarization.git

2. **Install the required packages:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your input text file:**
   
   Ensure you have a text file containing the text you want to summarize.

2. **Run the summarization script:**

    ```sh
    python summarize.py input_text.txt
    ```

    Replace `input_text.txt` with the path to your input text file.

3. **View the summary:**

   The summary will be printed to the console.
